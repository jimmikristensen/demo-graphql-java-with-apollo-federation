#+title: GraphQL Federation Demo (Java + Apollo Gateway)
#+author: Jimmi

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate how it is possible to support GraphQL Schema Federation with the Micronaut framework.

This repository presents a demo that composes the distinct schemas of Java (Micronaut) GraphQL servers into a federated data graph with Apollo Gateway.

The demo application is a fake service that is able to serve information on movies and series from a few downstream GraphQL servers through an Apollo Gateway (Federated gateway). 
The diagram below illustrates the architecture of this demo application.

Each downstream Java (Micronaut) service is responsible of exposing its context through the service destinct GraphQL schema:

- *Entity Service* serves information on movies and series through its schema
- *Search Service* handles searches on movies and series through its schena
- *Image Service* serves images belonging to either a movie, series or a background of a deck through its schema
- *Deck Service* serves collections of movies and series through its schema

* Versions used in this demo

- Java: 14
- Micronaut: 2.0.3
- Node: 14.16
- npm: 6.14.11 

* Preparing your GraphQL server for federation

/I am going to assume you already are familiar with setting up a regular GraphQL server with Micronaut, if not I suggest you try that first.
